# Introduction/Business Problem

### I want to open a tea shop in Toronto but I don’t know where is the best neighbor for it. After some research I believe people who drink coffee may get interested in tea. So I decide to open my tea shop near coffee shops.

# Data:

### I will reuse the Toronto data in last week and focus on only “coffee shops”.
